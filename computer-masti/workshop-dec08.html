  The participants were from different schools, boards and backgrounds. Many of 
  them were subject teachers with little exposure to computers. There were also 
  participants from NGOs working with children or under-privileged groups. 

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were classroom as well as lab sessions throughout the two days. The 
classroom sessions covered topics like: Applying the Five aspects of education 
to teaching, Pros and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cons of teaching computers, Planning and presentation of 
computer lessons, and Awareness of Health aspects of computers.

<p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were 4 lab sessions, giving the participants a hands-on experience of 
activities from the computer masti books. The first day was devoted to 1st and 
2nd std activities, the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; next day was hands-on activities from the 3rd and 4th 
std books. It is important for teachers to do each activity themselves, before 
asking children to do it.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
A tutorial session of installation of Ubuntu (Linux) on Windows was done, so 
that the participants feel confident about doing installation of software on the 
computers. Also a&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; programming session using SCRATCH, where they were given the 
basic programming concepts like step-wise thinking. 

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the end of the workshop, the participants were given a letter of 
participation. Many of the participants said they were happy to have got rid of 
their fear of computers.

<b>Sample feedback:</b><br>
&nbsp;Lesson plan sharing was very interesting. <br>
&nbsp;Learning through games was fun.<br>
&nbsp;Hands-on activity based teaching was useful and will be beneficial for 
children.<br>
&nbsp;We can use some of these games to teach other subjects. <br>
